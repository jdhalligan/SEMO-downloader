## Grafana and KDB+ Plugin Quick Installation
The following is a quick guide to installing Grafana with the kdb+ datasource plugin, for a more detailed guide please refer to the full guide on the [kdb+ datasource plugin's GitHub](https://github.com/AquaQAnalytics/grafana-kdb-datasource-ws/blob/master/Readme.md). 

#### Install Grafana:
Install the latest version of [Grafana](https://grafana.com/grafana/download/7.3.4).

#### Installing kdb+ datasource plugin:
 - Download the [latest release](https://github.com/AquaQAnalytics/grafana-kdb-datasource-ws/releases/tag/v1.0.1).
 - Extract the entire *grafana-kdb-datasource-ws* folder to {Grafana Install Directory}/grafana/data/plugins/.
 - Install the necessary dependencies for the plugin to run using npm:
```
npm install â€“g grunt-cli
npm install
grunt --install
``` 
 - Once the plugin has been installed with its corresponding dependencies, Grafana must be started/restarted. On the Windows operating system this can be done using Windows services, which can acessed by running ``services.msc`` via the windows Run box (windows key+r).
 
#### Configuring kdb+ instance:
First ensure that the kdb+ instance we wish Grafana to interact with is on an [open listening port](https://code.kx.com/q/basics/listening-port/). Then in order for Grafana to communicate with our kdb+ process we must set up the following custom .z.ws WebSocket message handler on that kdb+ instance:

``.z.ws:{ds:-9!x;neg[.z.w] -8! `o`ID!(@[value;ds[`i];{`$"'",x}];ds[`ID])}``

This function can be set up over a remote handle, qcon or by including it within the base code used to start that process.


#### Adding datasource:
Once the kdb+ instance is configured start up Grafana and add that kdb+ instance as a datasource, to do this navigate to the data-sources page in Grafana (*default address: http://localhost:3000*) and click *Add data source*.
At the bottom of this page under *Others* should be *KDB+*, click on this to set settings.
*Host* should be only the address and port of the kdb+ instance given as:

`ADDRESS:PORT`

*'ws://' is not required, processes running on the same machine have `localhost` address.*

Default Timeout is how long in ms each query will wait for a response (will default to 5000 ms).
